 <p>Zomato was founded as FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. The website started as a restaurant listing and recommendation portal. They renamed the company Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and also to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay.[8][9][10]

With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn.[11]

In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.[12] In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,[13] Qatar,[14] the United Kingdom,[15] the Philippines,[14] and South Africa.[16] In 2013, expanded to in New Zealand,[17] Turkey, Brazil and Indonesia, with website and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian and English languages.[18] In April 2014, it launched in Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon and Ireland in 2015.[19][20][21][22]</p>

<p color="orange">Zomato started its food delivery service in India in 2015,[26] initially partnering with companies such as Delhivery and Grab to fulfill deliveries from restaurants that did not have its own delivery service.[27] In April 2015, Zomato acquired the American online table reservation platform NexTable, which was subsequently renamed as Zomato Book.[28] In January 2016, it launched Zomato Book's table reservation facility on its application in India.[29] In April 2015, Zomato acquired cloud-based point of sale company MapleGraph Solutions,[30] and in April 2016, it launched its own Android point of sale system for restaurants called Zomato Base, which was built on MaplePOS.[31]

In February 2017, the firm announced plans to launch Zomato Infrastructure Services, a cloud kitchen infrastructure service to help partner restaurants expand their presence without incurring any fixed costs.[32] Later that year, it introduced a paid membership program called Zomato Gold using which subscribers could get offers and discounts on dining and food delivery at Zomato's partner restaurants.[33]</p>
